○	Fact Check List: Ensuring the content is factually accurate, especially for reports or case studies.  
○	Tail Generation: Extending the content logically to create depth in storytelling or analysis.  
○	Menu Actions: Presenting multiple action choices and guiding the AI to select one.  
○	Semantic Filter: Applying filters to control the tone, style, and accuracy of the content.  

2.	Choosing the Content Type:  
For this experiment, the chosen topic is:  
**Case Study on Business Success — “The Rise of Zomato: A Digital Transformation in Food Delivery Industry.”**

3.	For example, the case study focuses on how Zomato successfully adapted digital innovation, AI, and customer engagement to dominate India’s food delivery market.  

4.	Creating the Prompts:

○	Gradually refine the prompts, moving toward more complex techniques like decision-making, tail generation, and semantic filtering.  

5.	Generating and Refining Outputs:  
○	First generate a basic version of the case study.  
○	Then apply advanced prompts to improve structure, coherence, and factual details.  

6.	Review and Evaluation:  
Evaluate the final outputs for:  
○	Coherence – Logical and structured flow.  
○	Creativity/Originality – Clear insights and real-world relevance.
